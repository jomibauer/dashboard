# dashboard

This is a Python program designed to help organize your day and provide the user with entertaining or informative content.  It includes a planner that allows the user to add tasks that recur at different frequencies, as well as several widgets that can help the user learn (e.g. a word of the day widget) or simply entertain them (e.g. a picture of the day widget.). 


To run the program, download all the files into the same directory, then run Dashboard.py.
